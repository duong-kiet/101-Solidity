# Blockchain Token Standards Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various Ethereum token standards, including ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155. These implementations serve as a reference and learning resource for blockchain developers.

## Token Standards Overview

### ERC20
ERC20 is the most common token standard on Ethereum, used for fungible tokens. Each token is identical to another token in terms of type and value.

Key features:
- Transfer tokens between accounts
- Get the current token balance of an account
- Get the total supply of the token
- Approve whether an amount of token can be spent by a third party

### ERC721
ERC721 is the standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), where each token is unique and can represent ownership of digital or physical assets.

Key features:
- Transfer tokens between accounts
- Get the current token balance of an account
- Get the owner of a specific token
- Approve whether an amount of token can be spent by a third party
- Query metadata for each token

### ERC1155
ERC1155 is a multi-token standard that allows for both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract, providing more flexibility and efficiency.

Key features:
- Support for multiple token types in a single contract
- Batch transfers of multiple token types
- Balance tracking for multiple token types
- Metadata support for each token type
- Approval mechanism for all token types
